# Project: Printf Implementation

## Overview
This collaborative project involves the creation of a simplified version of the `printf` function in C. The task is to write a function named `_printf` that produces output according to a given format. The format string can contain conversion specifiers for characters (`c`), strings (`s`), and percent symbols (`%`). Additionally, the project requires handling conversion specifiers for integers (`d`, `i`). The primary goal is to mimic the basic functionality of the standard `printf` function without addressing certain complexities such as flag characters, field width, precision, and length modifiers.

## Concepts and Resources
Before diving into the project, it is recommended to review the concepts of group projects, pair programming, flowcharts, and technical writing. Understanding the secrets of `printf` and utilizing the provided resources on the group projects concept page, flowcharts concept page, and the `printf` function brief is crucial for successful completion.

## How to Compile
To compile the code, use the following command:

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
```

Be cautious not to push any C file containing a main function in the root directory of the project. Use a separate test folder for test files that include main functions.

## Testing
A sample test file (main.c) has been provided, demonstrating various uses of the `_printf` function. This file includes comparisons with the standard `printf` for verification. The provided test file covers scenarios like printing characters, strings, integers, unsigned integers, octals, hexadecimals, addresses, and more.

## Copyright and Plagiarism
This project emphasizes the importance of original work. Plagiarism is strictly forbidden, and team members are expected to develop solutions independently. Any violation of these rules may result in removal from the program.

Let's work together to create a reliable and efficient version of the `printf` function. Good luck!
